# Introduction to Python

## Variables

A variable is a name or label for a value  
ex.

```{python}
count = 55
size = 42.0
asldkjsk = 12
```

## Operators and Operands

- Operators: represent computational instructions and follow the PEMDAS order of operations.

- Operands: the variables and their corresponding values that the instructions are performed on

```{python}
print( 3 + 4 ) # output: 7
```

### Division

when using the division operator ( / ) all floating point numbers (float) are approximations.

```{python}
( 10 // 3 ) = 3
( 10 / 3 ) = 3.33333

int + float = float
print( 3 + 4.0 ) = 7.0
```

## String Concatenation

```{python}
print( '17' + '3' )
173
print("17" * 3)
171717
```

### Comments

- Use comments to make descriptions within the code.

```{python}
# Poor example:
# Calculate it
y = 2
x = 2 * 3.14 * y

# Good example:
# Calculate the circumference of a circle because ...
pi = 3.14
radius = 2
circumference = 2 * pi * radius

answer = 42
```
